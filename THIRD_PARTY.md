# JobsMaster

- As mentioned in the [ARCHITECTURE](ARCHITECTURE.md) file, we have used `Angular 13` as our frontend and `FASTAPI` as our backend.
- We have also used Angular UI components from the [Ant Design](https://ng.ant.design/components/overview/en) library for the JobsMaster UI and Components from the [Nebular](https://akveo.github.io/nebular/docs/components/components-overview) library for the Chat UI.
- These libraries only help us to create the UI components easily and quickly and doesn't contribute to the functionality of the application.
